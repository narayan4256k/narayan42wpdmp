The dominant style of American cinema is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema"><abbr title="Classical Hollywood">classical Hollywood cinema</abbr></a>, which developed from 1913 to 1969 and is still typical of most films made there to this day. While Frenchmen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re"><abbr title="Auguste and Louis Lumière">Auguste and Louis Lumière</abbr></a> are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema,[5] American cinema soon came to be a dominant force in the emerging industry. As of 2017, it produced the second-largest number of films of any single-language national cinema, after China, with more than 700 English-language films released on average every year.[6] While the national cinemas of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_Kingdom"><abbr title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</abbr></a> (299), Canada (206), Australia, and New Zealand also produce films in the same language, they are not considered part of the Hollywood system.

Contemporary Hollywood often outsources production to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
	<p>Hollywood is considered to be the oldest film industry, in the sense of being the place where the earliest film studios and production companies emerged. It is also the birthplace of various genres of cinema—among them comedy, drama, action, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film"><abbr title="Musical">Musical</abbr></a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film"><abbr title="Romance">Romance</abbr></a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film"><abbr title="Horror">Horror</abbr></a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"><abbr title="Science-Fiction">Science-Fiction</abbr></a>, and the war epic—and has set the example for other national film industries.</p>

	<p>In 1878, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge"><abbr title="Eadweard Muybridge">Eadweard Muybridge</abbr></a> demonstrated the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"><abbr title="Photography">photography</a> to capture motion. In 1894, the world's first commercial motion-picture exhibition was given in New York City, using Thomas Edison's kinetoscope. In the following decades, production of silent film greatly expanded, studios formed and migrated to California, and films and the stories they told became much longer. The United States produced the world's first sync-sound musical film, The Jazz Singer, in 1927,[8] and was at the forefront of sound-film development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around the thirty-mile zone in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Director D.W. Griffith was central to the development of a film grammar. Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) is frequently cited in critics' polls as the greatest film of all time.[9]</strong></p></font>

			Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio (/diˈkæprioʊ/; Italian: [diˈkaːprjo]; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor and film producer. Known for his work in biopics and period films, he is the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and three Golden Globe Awards. As of 2019, his films have grossed over $7.2 billion worldwide, and he has been placed eight times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Born in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career in the late 1980s by appearing in television commercials.

At age 19, he received critical acclaim and his first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He achieved international stardom with the star-crossed romances Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997). After the latter became the highest-grossing film at the time, he reduced his workload for a few years. In an attempt to shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other genres, including crime drama in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002); the latter marked the first of his many successful collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.
		</p>

		</p>
		<p>
			DiCaprio is the founder of Appian Way Productions, a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series Greensburg (2008–2010), and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on the environment. In 2005, he was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts, and in 2016, he appeared in Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.
